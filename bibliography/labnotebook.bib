        abstract = {We have used the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) to study faint UV stars in the core of the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. We confirm the presence of a fourth cataclysmic variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (hereafter CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al. to present evidence that CVs 1-4 all have faint disks and probably low accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the published spectra of Grindlay et al., we present new evidence that CVs 1-3 may be DQ Her systems, as originally suggested by Grindlay et al., and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as "nonflickerers" (NFs). Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the cluster center. Using detailed comparisons with stellar atmosphere models, we have determined log g =6.25 ± 1.0 and T eff =17,500 ± 5,000 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the luminosity of the NF, we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium WD having a mass of 0.25 M ☉ and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr (depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD.},

        abstract = {The AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) binaries are a rare group of hydrogen-deficient, ultrashort period, mass-transferring white dwarf binaries and are possible progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We present time-resolved spectroscopy of the recently discovered AM CVn binary SDSS J173047.59+554518.5. The average spectrum shows strong double-peaked helium emission lines, as well as a variety of metal lines, including neon; this is the second detection of neon in an AM CVn binary, after the much brighter system GP Com. We detect no calcium in the accretion disc, a puzzling feature that has been noted in many of the longer period AM CVn binaries. We measure an orbital period, from the radial velocities of the emission lines, of 35.2 ± 0.2 min, confirming the ultracompact binary nature of the system. The emission lines seen in SDSS J1730 are very narrow, although double-peaked, implying a low-inclination, face-on accretion disc; using the measured velocities of the line peaks, we estimate i ≤ 11°. This low inclination makes SDSS J1730 an excellent system for the identification of emission lines.},

sources that lie within the half-mass radius of the nearby,
core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 6397, using deep Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel imaging in
Hα, R, and B. Photometry of these images allows us to classify
candidate counterparts based on color-magnitude diagram location. In
addition to recovering nine previously detected cataclysmic variables
(CVs), we have identified six additional faint CV candidates, a total of
42 active binaries (ABs), two millisecond pulsars, one candidate active
galactic nucleus, and one candidate interacting galaxy pair. Of the 79
sources, 69 have a plausible optical counterpart. The 15 likely and
possible CVs in NGC 6397 mostly fall into two groups: a brighter group
of six for which the optical emission is dominated by contributions from
the secondary and accretion disk and a fainter group of seven for which
the white dwarf dominates the optical emission. There are two possible
transitional objects that lie between these groups. The faintest CVs
likely lie near the minimum of the CV period distribution, where an
accumulation is expected. The spatial distribution of the brighter CVs
is much more centrally concentrated than those of the fainter CVs and
the ABs. This may represent the result of an evolutionary process in
which CVs are produced by dynamical interactions, such as exchange
reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to larger orbital
radii, over their lifetimes, as they age and become fainter.},

        title = {Mass ratio determination from {Halpha} lines in {Black}-{Hole} {X}-ray transients},
        volume = {1603},
        url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160308920C},
        abstract = {We find that the mass ratio q in quiescent black hole (BH) X-ray transients is tightly correlated with the ratio of the double peak separation (DP) to the full-width-half maximum (FWHM) of the Halpha emission line, log q = -6.88 -23.2 log (DP/FWHM). The correlation is explained through the efficient truncation of the outer disc radius by the 3:1 resonance with the companion star. This is the dominant tidal interaction for extreme mass ratios q=M2/M1{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.25, the realm of BH (and some neutron star) X-ray transients. Mass ratios can thus be estimated with a typical uncertainty of {\textasciitilde}32\%, provided that the Halpha profile used to measure DP/FWHM is an orbital phase average. We apply the DP/FWHM-q relation to the three faint BH transients XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933 and predict q=0.026 (+0.038-0.007), 0.049 (+0.023-0.012) and 0.040 (+0.003-0.005), respectively. This new relation, together with the FWHM-K2 correlation presented in Paper I (casares 2015) allows the extraction of fundamental parameters from very faint targets and, therefore, the extension of dynamical BH studies to much deeper limits than was previously possible. As an example, we combine our mass ratio determination for Swift J1357-0922 with previous results to yield a BH mass of 12.4+-3.6 Msun. This confirms Swift J1357-0922 as one of the most massive BH low-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy.},
