        abstract = {We have used the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) to study faint UV stars in the core of the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. We confirm the presence of a fourth cataclysmic variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (hereafter CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al. to present evidence that CVs 1-4 all have faint disks and probably low accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the published spectra of Grindlay et al., we present new evidence that CVs 1-3 may be DQ Her systems, as originally suggested by Grindlay et al., and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as "nonflickerers" (NFs). Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the cluster center. Using detailed comparisons with stellar atmosphere models, we have determined log g =6.25 ± 1.0 and T eff =17,500 ± 5,000 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the luminosity of the NF, we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium WD having a mass of 0.25 M ☉ and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr (depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD.},

We present time-resolved spectroscopy of the recently discovered AM CVn binary SDSS J173047.59+554518.5. The average spectrum shows strong double-peaked helium emission lines, as well as a variety of metal lines, including neon; this is the second detection of neon in an AM CVn binary, after the much brighter system GP Com. We detect no calcium in the accretion disc, a puzzling feature that has been noted in many of the longer period AM CVn binaries. We measure an orbital period, from the radial velocities of the emission lines, of 35.2 ± 0.2 min, confirming the ultracompact binary nature of the system. The emission lines seen in SDSS J1730 are very narrow, although double-peaked, implying a low-inclination, face-on accretion disc; using the measured velocities of the line peaks, we estimate i ≤ 11°. This low inclination makes SDSS J1730 an excellent system for the identification of emission lines.},

42 active binaries (ABs), two millisecond pulsars, one candidate active
galactic nucleus, and one candidate interacting galaxy pair. Of the 79

possible CVs in NGC 6397 mostly fall into two groups: a brighter group
of six for which the optical emission is dominated by contributions from
the secondary and accretion disk and a fainter group of seven for which
the white dwarf dominates the optical emission. There are two possible
transitional objects that lie between these groups. The faintest CVs
likely lie near the minimum of the CV period distribution, where an
accumulation is expected. The spatial distribution of the brighter CVs
is much more centrally concentrated than those of the fainter CVs and
the ABs. This may represent the result of an evolutionary process in
which CVs are produced by dynamical interactions, such as exchange
reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to larger orbital
radii, over their lifetimes, as they age and become fainter.},

        abstract = {We find that the mass ratio q in quiescent black hole (BH) X-ray transients is tightly correlated with the ratio of the double peak separation (DP) to the full-width-half maximum (FWHM) of the Halpha emission line, log q = -6.88 -23.2 log (DP/FWHM). The correlation is explained through the efficient truncation of the outer disc radius by the 3:1 resonance with the companion star. This is the dominant tidal interaction for extreme mass ratios q=M2/M1{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.25, the realm of BH (and some neutron star) X-ray transients. Mass ratios can thus be estimated with a typical uncertainty of {\textasciitilde}32\%, provided that the Halpha profile used to measure DP/FWHM is an orbital phase average. We apply the DP/FWHM-q relation to the three faint BH transients XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933 and predict q=0.026 (+0.038-0.007), 0.049 (+0.023-0.012) and 0.040 (+0.003-0.005), respectively. This new relation, together with the FWHM-K2 correlation presented in Paper I (casares 2015) allows the extraction of fundamental parameters from very faint targets and, therefore, the extension of dynamical BH studies to much deeper limits than was previously possible. As an example, we combine our mass ratio determination for Swift J1357-0922 with previous results to yield a BH mass of 12.4+-3.6 Msun. This confirms Swift J1357-0922 as one of the most massive BH low-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy.},

Using F625W, F435W, and F658N filters with the Wide Field Channel (WFC), we show that these stars, 18 of which are newly
discovered, have magnitudes and colors consistent with those of
helium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) with masses {\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 M\_\{⊙\}. Their Hα - R 625 colors indicate that they have strong
Hα absorption lines, which distinguishes them from cataclysmic
variables in the cluster. The radial distribution of the He WDs is significantly more concentrated to the cluster center than that of either the CO WDs or the turnoff stars and most closely resembles that of the cluster's blue stragglers. Binary companions are required to explain the implied dynamical masses. We show that the companions cannot be main-sequence stars and are most likely heavy CO WDs. The number and photometric masses of the observed He WDs can be understood if {\textasciitilde}1\%-5\% of the main-sequence stars within the half-mass radius of the cluster have white dwarf companions with orbital periods in the range {\textasciitilde}1-20 days at the time they reach the turnoff. In contrast to the CO WD sequence, the He WD sequence comes to an end at R 625 sime 24.5, well above the magnitude limit of the observations. We explore the significance of this finding in the context of thick versus thin hydrogen envelope models and compare our results to existing theoretical predictions. In addition, we find strong evidence that the vast majority of the CO WDs in NGC 6397 down to T eff sime 10,000 K are of the DA class. Finally, we use the CO WD sequence together with theoretical cooling models to measure a distance to the cluster of 2.34 ± 0.13 kpc,

        abstract = {We present the photometric calibration of the Advanced Camera for 
Surveys (ACS). The ACS was installed in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
in 2002 March. It comprises three cameras: the Wide Field Channel (WFC),
optimized for deep near-IR survey imaging programs; the High Resolution
Channel (HRC), a high-resolution imager that fully samples the HST
point-spread function (PSF) in the visible; and the Solar Blind Channel
(SBC), a far-UV imager. A significant amount of data has been collected
to characterize the on-orbit performance of the three channels. We give
here an overview of the performance and calibration of the two CCD
cameras (WFC and HRC) and a description of the best techniques for
reducing ACS CCD data. The overall performance is as expected from
prelaunch testing of the camera. Surprises were a better-than-predicted
sensitivity in the visible and near-IR for both the WFC and HRC and an
unpredicted dip in the HRC UV response at {\textasciitilde}3200 Å. On-orbit
observations of spectrophotometric standard stars have been used to
revise the prelaunch estimate of the instrument response curves to best
match predicted and observed count rates. Synthetic photometry has been
used to determine zero points for all filters in three magnitude systems
and to derive interstellar extinction values for the ACS photometric
systems. Due to the CCD internal scattering of long-wavelength photons,
the width of the PSF increases significantly in the near-IR, and the
aperture correction for photometry with near-IR filters depends on the
spectral energy distribution of the source. We provide a detailed recipe
to correct for the latter effect. Transformations between the ACS
photometric systems and the UBVRI and WFPC2 systems are presented. In
general, two sets of transformations are available: one based on the
observation of two star clusters; the other on synthetic photometry. We
discuss the accuracy of these transformations and their sensitivity to
details of the spectra being transformed. Initial signs of detector
degradation due to the HST radiative environment are already visible. We
discuss the impact on the data in terms of dark rate increase, charge
transfer inefficiency, and ``hot'' pixel population.},
