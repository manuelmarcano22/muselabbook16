### http://manuelpm.me/muselabbook16/

I started the new Github repository (https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/muselabbook16/tree/gh-pages) for  what it should be my new labbook journal following the examples from [Jekyll-lablog](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog), this  [labnotebook](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and also [labnotebookmadsenlab](http://notebook.madsenlab.org/labnotebook.html).

It is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), build locally in my computer then pushed to the branch gh-pages to create the project [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).
