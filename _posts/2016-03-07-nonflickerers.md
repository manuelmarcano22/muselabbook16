### Heliu-Core White Dwarfs

NGC 6397 has population of so called "nonflickereres". This seem to be He WD with an massive Carbon-Oxygen WD. These are mentioned first in [Cool98][@Cool98NF], a spectra of one is studied in [Edmond98][@Edmonds98], three more are mention in [Taylor01][@taylor01]. And a comprehensive list of He WD can be found in [Strickler][@strickler09]. These can be interesting to studied since they can be sources for the LISA mission according to [Benacquista13][@benacquista13].


### nonflickerers (NF)

Using the coordinates of the first NF mentioned by [Cool98][@Cool98NF], and finding the coordinates in the paper [Strickler][@strickler09] I extracted the spectra. It is in the data folder. 

### Hubble image

To be able to find the correct source I looked in a Hubble image. There I can locate the star with the astrometry and then try to locate it in my datacube. The fits file image is called *hlsp_acsggct_hst_acs-wfc_ngc6397_f606w_v2_img.fits* and it is located in the data folder.
