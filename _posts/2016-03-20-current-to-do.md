##  Questions
- [ ] Using same SKYFLATS for two different days. 
- [ ] Correct spectra? Can see the redshift?
- [ ] He and H$\alpha$ line present, normal? 

## To-Do
- [ ] Do Optimal Extraction Algorithm in Python. 
- [ ] Align X-ray data with MUSE. 
- [ ] Try to figure out weird line in supposed place of the qLMXB U24. 
- [ ] Forget about the line and extract H$alpha$ emmision.
- [ ] Process spectra in IRAF
- [ ] Get  the spectra of the CVs.
- [ ] Get spectra of the He WD. Specially of NF2 since I have one to compared with. 
- [ ] Find information about the white dwarfs in the cluster
- [ ] Python routines to update productssof.txt and use this for routines. 
- [ ] Do a CUBE with and without using the bad pixel table.
- [ ] Make CUBE with lsf from calibration and created one.
