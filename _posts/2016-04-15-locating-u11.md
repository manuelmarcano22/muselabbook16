# U11


It turns out that U11 is in both Region 11 and Region 0. This is a screen shot of region 0:

#### Region 0

#### In Region 11:

Now I will try to combine both regions. I have the following exposure time per region:

- Region 0: 325 seconds
- Region 11: 340 seconds



# U5

Looking for U7 (CV10), I tried to locate the nearby sources. CV7 is not in the data but just in case here is where I think U5 is.

In [@cohn_identification_2010] it  classify as a possible AB with $H\alpha$ magnitude of 19.23, but Outside of R field. 

#### Region 17

- Region 17: 125. seconds

# U60

Should be in region 0 as well as U11.

- Region 0: 325 seconds

# U80

Should be around region 22
