### Terrible Mistake

Doing the combine datacube for the second night I discovered that the Offset list was only done for two exposures. The spectra for day 2 looks much better. 

### Second day observation

I finally was done reducing the observation for the second day. The next step is to combine them with the first day. 


### IRAF

IRAF is installed in the server and I can access it like:

```bash
marcano@edelweiss.cesr.fr
```
and then do: `.xiraf_redhat`

## To-Do
- [x] ~~Get combined DataCube for second day.~~ 
- [x] ~~Install IRAF and Pyraf with Ureka from the STScI.~~ No need now. Can use the one in the server. See details above.
