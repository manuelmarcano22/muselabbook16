### Limited Wavelength DATACUBES

I created a IMAGEFOV, Datacube, PIXTABLE_REDUCED and PIXTABLE_COMBINED for all the 45 different exposures. Now to do is to try to see how to combine them. I will meet with Dr. Finley to learn how to do this. 

### MUSE Pipeline Version 1.2.1

 Until this point I am currently using version 1.0.1 of the muse software pipeline. There is version 1.2.1 that was released. This included a new recipe for easy aligment.


## To-Do
- [x] ~~All the Datacubes and extra fits for the 45 exposures.~~ Did it with reduced wavelenght from 4000 to 5000 to reduce computing time and try to get the offsets.
