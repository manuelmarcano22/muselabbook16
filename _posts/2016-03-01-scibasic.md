### Problems with scibasic "recipe"

If I run with esorex in $HOME/musepipeline1.2.1/bin/esorex it doesn't work. The process freezes and the checksum doesn't work. This is the same for both creating OBJECT and STD. It doesn't give me the same error with the one installed in /usr/local/bin. The only difference is the CPL version, 6.6 vs 6.6.1, but with both the checksums doesn't work.

I try putting the option to check the checksum to FALSE in esorexrc to see if this was the problem. It works like that. I will try creating the objects with `esorex.caller.no-checksum=TRUE` 


### New recipe dir

I change the local installation of the muse pipeline to `/home/detoeuf/muse1.2.1` and now it includes the version 6.6.1 of CPL and not the 6.6. This was to try to fix the problem when executing the recipe *muse_scibasic* for objects and standards, but it didn't work.
