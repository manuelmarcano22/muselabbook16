I have been slacking a bit writing here, but hopefully I will continue to write more often. 

# Core Radius

When trying to get a value for the core radius of NGC 6397 I found two values. One from [@Harris][Harris]. He gives a value of 3 arcsec, but in the section "previous analysis of NGC 6397" they cite work done with the Hubble Space Telescope they get a core collapse of around 5.5 arcsec. 


# Proposal

For the proposal to ask for observation time to observe the neutron star, U24. It is a LMXB. Dr. Sebastien ask me to get some pictures for the proposal.

# Aligning X-ray and MUSE data

The astrometry of the chandra image and MUSE data are not perfect, so they don't match exactly. I
