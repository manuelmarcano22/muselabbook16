### Pyraf to extract Equivalent Width 

There are several ways to do this. One is using `splot`, then the option **e**. This *measure equivalent width by marking two continuum points around the line to be measured*. I should take the two of them. One at continuum and the other from where it starts. This is since maybe we will have emission inside an absorption line. 

Also can fit a single line profile with `k + (g, l or v)`. Need to mark two continuum points and select the profile. Do this for the continuum and inside absorption line.  


Also can do it with d, then g. I cant since it is very low signal. Something like this:

```bash
splot U24_minusbackground_circ_1_.fits  xmin=6500 xmax=6700 
```

### Horne Optimal Spectra Extraction

There is a method mention in [Horne86][@SpectraHorne86], the idea is to try to do it with Python. There is an example code in (http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~ianc/python/_modules/spec.html#optimalExtract)
