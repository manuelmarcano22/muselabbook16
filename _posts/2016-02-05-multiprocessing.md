### Memory Overload RAM

There is a problem with the 60 flats and ARC that I have. I only have 30 GB of ram so need to run them in part then combine them to get the final one. Can do it with option

`output-prefix`

### Multiprocessing

#### task set

found in (https://www.eso.org/sci/activities/santiago/projects/sc-computing.html) should run it like:

`taskset -c 0-23 esorex ...`


### Data

The data is now in the path: `/mnt/data/MUSE` 


## To-Dos
- [x] Download all the arc-lamp and SKYFLATS
