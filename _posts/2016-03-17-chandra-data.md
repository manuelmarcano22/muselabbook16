### X-Ray Chandra Data

[Dr. Sebastien Guillot](http://www.astro.puc.cl/~sguillot/) gave me two fits of the Chandra X-Ray data taken of NGC6397. They are in the hard drive. 

### ds9 

#### Mosaic 

Open a mosaic in ds9 do:

```bash
ds9 -mosaic
```

#### Regions

I can manually select regions in the X-ray data, then export it as a .reg. This way they can be easily displayed overlaying them in an image. 

#### Contours

I can export the contour from the X-Ray and then overlay the contour in the IMAGE_FOV of the MUSE data. 

## To-Do
- [x] ~~Download data for all days to search CVs outside Core-Radius~~. I downloaded all the data and now is procesced. Need to combine them.
