### qLMXB

Cool stuff look into it how to extract it. 


```bash
DPUSER> 3dspec(buffer1,237, 332,1, /sum)
```

Strange line at 6404 Angstrom. And a dip at 7600 and peak at 7626. The last dip and peak is common. Check that is not earth like it seems in Fig. 2 with the spectra in the first MUSE NGC 6397 paper. 

Now found out if line is real and not only noise. Get spectra with different methods in QFitsView. 

### White Image of Whole Cluster

To try to locate sources seen by Chandra outside of the Core Radius, I have to download and process for all the observation days. This is to try to locate new X-rays source seen by Chandra outside of the Core Radius.
