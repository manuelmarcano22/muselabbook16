## Commits

### Python

Created a little script that writes the full path and frame tag of files. *seetype.py*.

### Bash

The file createbias creates the sof for the recipe muse_bias and then uses EsoRex to get the master bias. 

The same for the flats.

### EsoRex

YOu can run esorex with a configuration file. with the flag `--config=`
In the file be sure to put the output directory, logfile dir.
If using EsoRex can use the .fz. In page 25 of Manual. 

Can work with up to 24 threads. Computer has 28. Found out that with `nproc`. So used `OMP_NUM_THREADS=24` before the esorex commands. Also need to use taskset. 

### BIAS

~~It works with the first 10 BIAS or the last 10. The moment I go from 10 to 11 it doesn't produced the final MASTER_BIAS.fits.~~. I needed to use to use `taskset` with for example `-c 0-5` with `--nifu=-1` and process them in parallel.
