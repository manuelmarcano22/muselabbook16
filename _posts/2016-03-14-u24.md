### FLAT,SKY

For some observations night there are not SKYFLATs in the correct instrument mode (WFM-N). This is the case for 2014-07-29, 2014-07-31. So I had to do the following thing:

- Use SKYFLATS taking at 22h UT on 2014-07-27, for  2014-07-27, 2014-07-28 and 2014-07-30.
- Use SKYFLATS taking at 22h UT on 2014-08-02, for both 2014-07-31 and 2014-08-01.

All the observations are taking around 1h to 2h UT. 


### U24 (LMXB)

To try to see if the emission line seen for U24 around 640.5 nm, I extracted the spectra around that area with QFitsView to the different datasets (First Night only, Second Night and both Nights), using different options (sum, average, median). This is done with DPUSER script to be run using QFitsView. The script is in the folder misc and with the extension`.dpuser`.

It is hard to believe that the 640.5 nm line is the shifted H$\alpha$, the next thing to do is to look at the possible H$\alpha$ emission from the source and look at the [MUSE Exposure Time Calculator](https://www.eso.org/observing/etc/bin/gen/form?INS.NAME=MUSE+INS.MODE=swspectr). Calculate it for a SNR of 3.
