MUSE  2016

# MUSE Data Reduction 2016

This is the repository for my personal lab notebook for the research project done in Spring 2016 at [IRAP](http://www.irap.omp.eu/en) under the supervision of [Dr. Natalie Webb](http://userpages.irap.omp.eu/~nwebb/). The other repository of the project with the bash and python scripts used can be found at (https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/muse2016).
